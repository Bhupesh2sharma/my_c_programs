Requirements
In order to run the programs in this repository, you will need to have a C compiler installed on your system. I have tested these programs using the GCC compiler on a Linux machine, but they should work on other systems as well.

Usage
To compile and run a program, navigate to its directory and use the following commands:

sh
Copy code
gcc program_name.c -o program_name
./program_name
Replace program_name with the name of the C file you want to compile and run.

License
This repository is licensed under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more information.

Feel free to modify and use these programs for your own purposes. If you find any issues or have any suggestions for improvement, please feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request.
